# SAT Prep Quiz App

This is a simple Flask web application that generates SAT practice quizzes for kids.  
Users can choose a topic (language or math), select the grade level, and specify how many questions they want.  
The app uses OpenAI's GPT model to create multiple choice questions, displays them one at a time, and scores the answers at the end.
